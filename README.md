# HTML Structure:
- The document begins with the usual HTML5 doctype declaration.
- Inside the 'head' section, there are meta tags for character set and viewport configuration. The page title is set to "tailwind," and an external CSS stylesheet 
  named "style.css" is linked.
- The 'body' section contains the content of the webpage.
- The 'header' element represents the website's header section. It contains the site's logo (a green circle with a white icon), site name ("Geekster"), navigation 
  links ("Home," "About Us," "Contact Us," "Map"), and a button with the text "Geek" and a dropdown icon.
- The 'section' element represents the main content section of the webpage. It contains a container with two columns. The first column contains a title ("Before - 
  they sold out readymade gluten"), a paragraph of text, and two buttons ("Yes" and "No"). The second column contains an image.
# CSS Structure:
- The CSS code begins with some global styling and resets. It sets the box-sizing to border-box, removes default border styles, and normalizes various styles for consistent rendering across browsers.
- It defines some default styles for HTML elements like headings, links, and form elements.
- Media queries for different screen sizes are included to make the page responsive. These media queries adjust the max-width of the container for different breakpoints, ensuring the content remains readable on various devices.
- Tailwind CSS classes are defined in the CSS code. These classes provide styles for various aspects of the HTML structure, such as margins (m-10, mx-auto), padding (p-10, px-3), text styles (text-3xl, text-gray-600), background colors (bg-blue-500, bg-gray-100), and more.
- There are also hover and focus styles defined, like hover:bg-blue-600 for changing the background color on hover and focus:outline-none for removing outlines on focus.
- Media queries are used to define specific styles for different screen sizes, such as tablet (@media (min-width: 768px)) and large desktop (@media (min-width: 1024px)) sizes.
- The CSS code also defines custom CSS variables (prefixed with --tw-) that can be used to customize the styles easily.
